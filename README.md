## 📚 Feature Details

### AI-Powered Search Technology
DiffiScore uses semantic search technology that understands the meaning behind your queries:

1. **Text Embeddings**: Converts questions and search queries into numerical vectors
2. **Vector Similarity**: Finds questions whose vectors are closest to your query vector
3. **FAISS Index**: Uses Facebook's FAISS for efficient similarity search
4. **Metadata Filtering**: Applies filters for subjects and difficulty levels

For example, searching for "algebra equations" might return questions about solving for x, even if they don't explicitly contain those words.

### Text Extraction Process
When you extract text from an image:

1. The image is sent to the backend server
2. The Gemini AI service processes the image
3. Text content is recognized and extracted
4. Results are returned and displayed
5. Images with clear, well-formatted text work best

### PDF Export System
The PDF export feature:

1. Collects all selected question data
2. Processes each image sequentially
3. Extracts text when available
4. Places images and text in a formatted PDF
5. Creates page breaks as needed
6. Returns a downloadable document

### Analytics Generation
The analytics dashboard shows:

1. **Processing Metrics**: Average time to process questions
2. **Question Distribution**: Breakdown by subject as pie charts
3. **Difficulty Analysis**: Histograms of difficulty levels
4. **Recent Activity**: Timeline of system usage
5. **Performance Trends**: Changes in processing time

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Upload Failures
**Issue**: Files fail to upload or process
**Solutions**:
- Check that the file is a supported format (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- Verify that the uploads folder exists and has write permissions
- Ensure file size is under 10MB
- Check backend console for specific error messages

#### Search Returns No Results
**Issue**: Searches don't return expected results
**Solutions**:
- Try more general search terms
- Ensure questions have been uploaded and processed
- Check if the FAISS index is initialized (faiss_index exists)
- Try resetting the database with the Reset button

#### Text Extraction Problems
**Issue**: Text extraction returns incorrect or no text
**Solutions**:
- Ensure the image has clear, legible text
- Check if OCR dependencies are installed correctly
- Try uploading a higher resolution image
- Images with hand-written text may have lower accuracy

#### PDF Export Fails
**Issue**: PDF export doesn't complete or has errors
